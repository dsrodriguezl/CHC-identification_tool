# CHC-identification_tool

Here I have developed an excel file tool for aiding the process of identifying insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC).
The Excel file is divided in three pages, CHC-Identification, Carlson(1998)-mehtyl alakanes, and post-DMDS.

The "CHC-Identification" page relies on several formulas, conditional formatting, and data validation settings to display/indicate the user the total mass diagnostic ions (Tm), as well as the fragmentation diagnostic ions of hydrocarbons with specified molecular traits (e.g. chain length). It can also indicate the position of methylation(s) for mono-, di-, and trimethyl-branched alkanes of a given chain length, if the theoretical fragmentation ions are provided by the user.
