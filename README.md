# CHC-identification_xlsx-tool

Here I have developed an excel file tool for aiding the process of identifying insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC).
The Excel file is divided in three pages, CHC-Identification, Carlson(1998)-mehtyl alkanes, and post-DMDS.

The CHC-Identification page is the main tool, it relies on several formulas, conditional formatting, and data validation settings to display/indicate the user the total mass diagnostic ions (Tm), as well as the fragmentation diagnostic ions of hydrocarbons with specified molecular traits (e.g. chain length). It can also indicate the position of methylation(s) for mono-, di-, and trimethyl-branched alkanes of a given chain length, if the theoretical fragmentation ions are provided by the user.

The Carlson(1998)-mehtyl alkanes displays two figures on the elution pattern of mono-, di-, tri- and tetramethyl-branched alkanes of the same chain length (33 carbons), which have been taken from Carlson _et. al_ (1998) paper (The link to the paper is included in the page as source). This figures are helpful in the process of identifying methyl-branched alkanes, and complementary to the CHC-identification tool of the first page.

The Post-DMDS page is to be used, as its name suggests, after a DMDS derivatization. This page is empty, but the plan is to set it similarly to the first page, its purpose would be aiding to determine the position of unsaturation(s) in the hydrocarbon chain lengths of alkenes (maybe also alkadienes) which requires the derivatization of the sample.

## How to use it?
